    <h1>For the love of Fried Chicken</h1>
    <p>Fried chicken is one of my favorite things to eat! It's also the very first food I learned how to cook on my own.</p>

    <h2>Popular fried chicken styles from around the globe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>Korean</em> fried chicken</strong></li>
      <p>Twice-fried so it's extra crispy. Korean fried chicken also owes its spicy kick to gochujang sauce.</p>
      <li><strong><em>Taiwanese</em> fried chicken</strong></li>
      <p>Thse fried chicken bites are topped with salt, pepper, and chilli powder and typically served from street carts.</p>
      <li><strong><em>Japanese</em> fried chicken</strong></li>
      <p>In this version, morsels of chicken are first marinated in soy sauce and other seasonings, then deep fried in potato starch, providing a light tempura like texture.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Fun Fried Chicken Facts</strong></h2>
    <p>Europeans have a documented history of frying chickens as far back as the Middle Ages. But it was the Scots, specifically, who preferred to deep-fry their chickens in fat.</p>
